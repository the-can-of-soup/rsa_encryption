# RSA Encryption
A simple text-based Python RSA encryption/decryption tool. Works on encryptions from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY6scAHNgZw

**THIS PROGRAM SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ENCRYPT SENSITIVE INFORMATION. This program contains no additional security measures on top of Textbook RSA, which makes it not secure enough for practical use.**

## Dependencies
- This program depends on [Soup TUI](https://github.com/the-can-of-soup/soup_tui). Simply download the repo, extract it, and move the folder into the folder alongside `rsa_encryption.py`.
- This program requires `sympy`. Install it with `pip install sympy` or `python -m pip install sympy`.
